								<h2>Process</h2>
								<!--<p>We follow Agile Software Development Methodology with the three simple steps.</p>-->
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<!--<li>
				<span class="image"><img src="Meeting31.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<h3><strong>Requirements Gathering</strong></h3>
				<p>Requirements are the key components for any business project. We understand your needs, we break the requirements into Business Requirements, Functional Requirements and Non Functional Requirements, we define Scope of Work and define Goals to achieve better results.</p>
			</li>-->
								<li>
									<span class="image"><img src="Meeting31.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3><strong>Project Definition</strong></h3>
									<p>In this phase, we discuss complete details of the product with clients. Once we assemble the required information, we develop a Project Definition to highlight the scope of work. The maximum cost of the project is also attached. The client makes necessary adjustments to the Project Definition, contracts signed, and work commenced.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="image"><img src="Design1.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3><strong>Design / Prototype</strong></h3>
									<p>During the design phase, we maintain constant contact with the client to ensure that all the expectations are met. We generate design documents and review them with the client. We iterate until the client is fully satisfied. Our engineers then materialize the design document into the product.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="image"><img src="Coding1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3><strong>Development</strong></h3>
									<p>The development process involves multiple demos at various stages to get the client's feedback on the product's progress. This help clients know exactly where we are with the schedule and if the product is shaping up according to their requirements. We are flexible with making changes or adding to the specifications whenever feasible.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="image"><img src="Testing2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3><strong>Testing</strong></h3>
									<p>Preliminary testing of the product is performed by the team internally. Then, we work closely with the clients and a small user-group to test the product to identify bugs and missing features.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="image"><img src="Support.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3><strong>Support</strong></h3>
									<p>Our exceptional support for all products includes initial training sessions, remote assistance, training videos, etc. All of our products include prompt and detailed error notification system so we can start working on the issues immediately.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="image"><img src="Maint1.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3><strong>Maintenance</strong></h3>
									<p>We perform routine server management and update our tools on a timely manner so that our clients can utilize the latest in technology. Small feature upgrades can be implemented on the fly, and major features are initiated by a formal project proposal.</p>
								</li>
								<!--<li>
				<span class="image"><img src="Coding1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<h3><strong>Project Development</strong></h3>
				<p>Once we got the initial requirements, we perform Planning, Analysing the requirements, Design the Architecture, Develop the application, perform vigorous Testing on all the environments and finally, Implement the complete system in production environment for the customers to use.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="image"><img src="Delivery1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<h3><strong>Support &amp; Maintenance</strong></h3>
				<p>We do understand that the requirements can change, even in the development stage. We can implement any new requirements at any stage of the project. After all the changes are done and all the handoffs are made, we will provide the software that the customers are looking for.</p>
